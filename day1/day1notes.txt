Applets:

Applets are java programs which can run within a browser.

Applications:

Java Programs which can run outside the browser.

JRE----------Java Runtime Environment.

The platform independence of java is achieved through a platform dependent JRE.

JRE is platform depedent.

JRE contains

1. Instruction Set
2. Register Set
3. Stack Definition
4. Heap Definition

When java code is compiled, it is converted into a platform independent bytecode.
	compilation
.java--------------->.class (byte code)

This bytecode is run by the JRE.

JRE---------------(JVM+ System Libraries)

JVM------------Java Virtual Machine-------Interprets the java bytecode into runtime instruction.

class loader-------------dynamically loads the classes into memory
byte code verifier-------verifies whether the byte code is in correct format.


procedural programming:
Follows a top down approach. A main function calles other subroutines or functions.

Examples: C,Fortran,Pascal

object oriented programming:
Object is the building block of an application.
Any real world component is modelled as an object.
Any real world component has state and behaviour.
For example, if person is a real word component, his name and age are examples of state and speaking and  walking are examples of behaviours.
In object oriented programming, the state is modelled as data and behaviour is modelled as function(method).

The data and the functions(methods) which act on those data are encapsulated within a class.

Examples: C++,Java,C#


functional programming:
A function is used as the building block of an application.
Supports:
a function being as an argument to another function
a function can return another function.
anonymous functions(functions without name)

Examples: Scala,Groovy,Python

Class is blueprint of the object.
Object is instance of a class.

Employee e1=new Employee() is equivalent to the following 2 statements.

Employee e1; //declares the e1 is as a reference variable of type Employee
e1=new Employee();//creates an object of Employee and assigns it to the variable e1.


A reference variable can point to an object.
The new operator dynamically allocates memory for the object.

new constructor()


this------------denotes the  current object.

constructor()------special method which has the same name as the class.
It can be invoked only once in the life cycle of an object.
It is invoked only during the creation of the  object with new operator.

ref_variable=new constructor();

All the classes have a default constructor with the following syntax.

class A{
}

is equivalent to 

class A{
	A()
	{
	}
}

A a1=new A();

Constructor does not have a return type.
	
javap--------------lists the data members ,constructors and methods of the class.

overloading:

We can have more than one method with the same name. The methods differ based on the arguments passed.


When a constructor is not defined in a class, a default constructor is automatically provided by 
the compiler.

So 

class A{
}

is equivalent to 

class A{
	A()
	{
	}
}


When a constructor is already in a class, compiler will not provide a default constructor.

The class,
class A{
	A(int x)
	{
	}
}
will not have a default constructor.

If you want to add a no argument constructor , it should be explicitly added as shown below.

class A{
	A(int x)
	{
	}
	A()
	{
	}
}



Naming conventions:

class name---------camel case
variables/methods----------lower camel case
packages-------lower case
constants/enums---upper case

package com.training.ge;

class CompanyDetails{
	private int discountRate;
	public static final String COMPANY_NAME="GE"; 
}


package:

Package is a collection of classes & interfaces grouped under a common name.
package name can have hierarchies.

package pack1;
package com.pack1;

package com.training.ge;

Each . symbol denotes a subfolder in the underlying file system.

In java, it is mandatory that if the class is public, the class name and filename should be same.
ie 

public class A{
}

should be defined in a file called A.java


When a class is not part of a package, it is said to be in the default package.


classpath option is used to specify where to look for the class files.



jar cvf jar_file list_of_classes


c------create
v------verbose(detailed info)
f------file
